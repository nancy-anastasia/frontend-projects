# Frontend Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to my Frontend Projects Repository!

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and capabilities in frontend development, featuring three distinct projects that demonstrate my proficiency with modern web technologies. These projects are built with a focus on responsive design, user experience, and leveraging the full potential of **React**, **TypeScript**, **JavaScript**, **React Router**, **Redux**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Node.js (Express.js)**, **MongoDB**, **RESTful APIs**, **CSS** and **Chakra UI** among other tools.

**Gamepedia** is a dynamic game catalog leveraging the rawg.io API to provide real-time data on a vast array of video games, highlighting my skills in API integration and responsive UI design.

**TypoTrack** offers an interactive typing experience, designed to improve typing skills with real-time feedback, showcasing my proficiency in developing web tools focused on user needs.

**UrbanGear Shop** is a modern online store showcasing my expertise in responsive UI design and state management using Redux, featuring a dynamic product grid, a sliding navigation drawer, and a fully functional shopping cart with real-time updates.

These projects are testament to my commitment to clean code, thoughtful design, and the creation of engaging, user-friendly web applications. Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or just a tech enthusiast, I invite you to explore these projects to get a sense of my approach to problem-solving and design in the realm of frontend development.
